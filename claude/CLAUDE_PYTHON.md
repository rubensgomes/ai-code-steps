## Formatting and Style

1. Use **Black** for auto-formatting.
2. Follow **PEP8** for Python code.

## Source Code Organization

1. Follow the standard Poetry source code layout structure.
2. Use `src/{{MODULE_PATH}}/` for the main project source code
   sub-folder (e.g., `src/javamcp`).
3. Use `tests/` for test package structure (e.g., `tests/`).
4. Create sub-folders to improve separation of concerns and group related
   functionality.
5. MUST use a feature-based source code organization.
6. MUST avoid large monolithic modules.

## Language Specific Guidelines

1. Use **Pydantic** models for request/response DTO objects..
2. Use **async/await** for I/O-bound operations to improve performance.
3. Use **type hints** everywhere (e.g., def foo(x: int) -> str).
4. Raise meaningful exceptions, donâ€™t return None silently.
5. Use **f-strings** for formatting (Python 3.6+).
6. Use `is` and `is not` for None checks (e.g., if x is None).
7. Use `with` statement for file operations to ensure proper resource
   management.
8. Use `pathlib` for file system paths instead of `os.path`.
9. Avoid wildcard imports (e.g., from module import *).
10. Prefer `enumerate()` over `range(len())` for loops.
11. **MUST** add `# Generated by Claude` comment at the top of a new Python file.
12. **MUST** add `# Modified by Claude` comment prior to modifications.

## Testing Guidelines

1. **MUST** use `pytest` as the testing framework.
2. Place tests in the `tests/` directory mirroring the `src/` structure.
3. Use **pytest fixtures** for setup/teardown logic.
4. Use **pytest-cov** for measuring test coverage.
5. **Avoid** unnecessary mocking -- mock external dependencies only (DB, APIs).
6. Use **pytest-mock** for mocking dependencies.
7. **Test** behavior and outcomes, not implementation details.
8. **Use** parametrized tests (@pytest.mark.parametrize) to cover multiple
   inputs.
9. **Keep** tests small, focused, and fast.
10. Write tests for both success and failure scenarios.
11. Aim for high test coverage (80%+), especially for critical components.
12. Name tests clearly to indicate what they are testing.
13. **MUST** test edge cases and error handling.
